          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Esubu SACCO was founded in 2015 by three childhood friends from Bungoma County. 
            With humble beginnings as a community table-banking group in a small rural market, 
            the founders saw firsthand how limited access to credit was holding back farmers, 
            boda boda riders, mama mbogas, and teachers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their mission was simple: create a safe, transparent, and member-owned SACCO 
            that empowers low- and medium-income earners to save consistently and access loans fairly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since then, Esubu SACCO has grown into a fully licensed deposit-taking SACCO under SASRA, 
            now serving over 8,000 members across Kenya, both online and in-person.
          </p>
          <p>
            We still honor our roots â€” we know our members by name, and we design systems 
            that serve real Kenyan lives.
