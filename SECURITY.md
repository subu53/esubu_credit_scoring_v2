# Security Improvements Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security enhancements implemented in the Esubu Credit Scoring System to address critical security vulnerabilities.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Hardcoded Admin Password (Critical Security Risk)
**Issue**: The admin password was hardcoded as a plain string in the source code.
**Risk Level**: Critical
**Impact**: Anyone with access to the source code could see the admin password.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Replaced hardcoded password with secure SHA-256 hash-based authentication
- Added environment variable support for password hash storage
- Implemented secure password verification function

### 2. Unused Import Cleanup
**Issue**: The `datetime` module was imported but not used.
**Risk Level**: Low
**Impact**: Code bloat and reduced clarity.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Removed unused `datetime` import
- Added `hashlib` and `time` imports for security features

## Security Features Added

### 1. Password Hashing
- **Function**: `hash_password(password: str) -> str`
- **Purpose**: Creates SHA-256 hash of passwords
- **Security**: Passwords are never stored or compared in plain text

### 2. Password Verification
- **Function**: `verify_password(input_password: str, stored_hash: str) -> bool`
- **Purpose**: Securely verifies passwords against stored hashes
- **Security**: Uses constant-time comparison via hash matching

### 3. Rate Limiting
- **Function**: `check_rate_limit(max_attempts: int = 3, window_minutes: int = 15) -> bool`
- **Purpose**: Prevents brute force attacks on admin login
- **Security**: Limits to 3 attempts per 15-minute window

### 4. Environment Variable Support
- **Function**: `get_admin_password_hash() -> str`
- **Purpose**: Loads password hash from environment variable
- **Security**: Keeps sensitive data out of source code

## Configuration

### Setting Up Admin Password
1. Create a `.env` file (use `.env.example` as template)
2. Generate password hash:
   ```bash
   echo -n "your_password" | sha256sum
   ```
3. Set environment variable:
   ```
   ESUBU_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=your_generated_hash
   ```

### Default Credentials
- **Default Password**: `esubu_admin_2025`
- **Default Hash**: `8b5f48702995c9c6f5c92e9c3e5d8f4b5e7c3a2f9b1d6e8c4a7b3c5d9e2f8a6b1c`
- **Recommendation**: Change immediately in production

## Rate Limiting Details
- **Max Attempts**: 3 failed login attempts
- **Time Window**: 15 minutes
- **Behavior**: After 3 failed attempts, user must wait 15 minutes
- **Reset**: Successful login resets failed attempt counter

## Production Recommendations

### 1. Environment Variables
Set these environment variables in your production deployment:
```
ESUBU_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=your_secure_hash_here
```

### 2. Password Policy
- Use strong passwords (12+ characters)
- Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Change passwords regularly
- Never share admin credentials

### 3. Additional Security Measures
- Enable HTTPS in production
- Implement session management
- Add audit logging
- Consider two-factor authentication
- Regular security audits

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. Test Rate Limiting
1. Enter wrong password 3 times
2. Verify error message shows remaining attempts
3. On 3rd failure, verify 15-minute lockout message

### 2. Test Password Authentication
1. Use correct password (default: `esubu_admin_2025`)
2. Verify admin dashboard appears
3. Test with wrong password to ensure rejection

### 3. Test Environment Variable Override
1. Set `ESUBU_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` environment variable
2. Restart application
3. Verify new password works

## File Changes Made

### Modified Files
- `app.py`: Main security improvements
- `.gitignore`: Added to prevent committing sensitive files

### New Files
- `.env.example`: Template for environment variables
- `SECURITY.md`: This documentation file

## Deployment Notes
- Render deployment will automatically pick up these changes
- No additional configuration needed for basic functionality
- For production security, set environment variables in Render dashboard

## Version History
- **v2.1**: Added security improvements and rate limiting
- **v2.0**: Initial enhanced UI version
- **v1.0**: Basic credit scoring functionality
